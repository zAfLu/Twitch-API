## Interactive Embed
```html
<script src= "http://player.twitch.tv/js/embed/v1.js"></script>
<div id="{PLAYER_DIV_ID}"></div>
<script type="text/javascript">
	var options = {
		width: 854,
		height: 480,
		channel: "{CHANNEL}", 
		//video: "{VIDEO_ID}"		
	};
	var player = new Twitch.Player("{PLAYER_DIV_ID}", options);
	player.setVolume(0.5);
</script>
```

### Options
- `width:Number`	: width of embed player in pixels
- `height:Number`	: height of embed player in pixels
- `channel:String`	: channel name for live streams `monstercat` 
- `video:String`	: video id for past broadcast `v40464143` 

Either a channel or a video can be loaded at one time.

### Embed Player Calls
All calls are synchronous.

#### Playback Controls
`pause():void`

Pauses player

`play():void`

Begins playing specified content.

`setVideo(videoid:String):void` 

- `videoid`     : video id (e.g. `"v1234567890"`)

`setChannel(channelname:String):void`

- `channelname`: channel name 

`seek(timestamp:Float):void`

Seeks to `timestamp` in video and resumes playing, if paused. Does not work for live streams. 
- `timestamp`   : timestamp to seek to (in seconds)

`setQuality(quality:String):void`

There are 5 available qualities: `"chunked"`, `"high"`, `"medium"`, `"low"`, `"mobile"`.
Quality will default to `"chunked"`if there are no transcodes available for the video. `"chunked"` is equivalent to the "Source" quality.
- `quality`: quality wanted (e.g. `"high"`) 

#### Volume Controls

`setVolume(volumelevel:Float):void`

- `volumelevel`: volume level between 0.0 and 1.0

`setMuted(muted:Boolean):void`

- `muted`: `true` mutes the player independent of volume setting, `false` unmutes

`getVolume():Float`

Returns volume level, between 0.0 and 1.0

`getMuted():Boolean`

Returns `true` if muted, else `false`

#### Player Status
`getEnded():Boolean`

Returns `true` if stream or video has ended, else `false`

`getDuration():Float`

Returns duration of video in seconds. Does not work for live streams. 

`getCurrentTime():Float`

Returns current timestamp in seconds for video. Does not work for live streams. 

`getQuality():String`

Returns current quality of playback. (e.g. `"high"`)

`getQualities():String[]`

Returns available qualities. (e.g. `["chunked", "high", "medium", "low", "mobile"]` or `["chunked"]`)

`isPaused():Boolean`

Returns `true` if paused, else `false`. Buffering or seeking is considered playing.

`getChannel():String`

Returns the channel's name. Doesn't work for videos. 

`getVideo():String`

Returns the video's id. Doesn't work for channels. 

`getPlaybackStats():Object`

Returns an `Object` with the stats on the player and the current video or live stream.

#### Event Handling

`addEventListener(event:String, callback:Function)`

- `event`     : the event to listen to `"pause"`
- `callback`  : function to call when `event` is triggered `function() { console.log("Event fired"); }`

`removeEventListener(event:String, callback:Function)`

- `event`     : the `event` the `callback` is associated with
- `callback`  : the function to remove 


### Events
Events emitted by player. Call `addEventListener(event:String, callback:Function)` to listen to events.

- `"ready"`  : Emitted when player is ready to accept function calls.
- `"play"`   : Emitted when player is playing.
- `"pause"`  : Emitted when player is paused. Buffering and seeking is not considered paused.
- `"ended"`  : Emitted when video or stream ends.
- `"online"` : Emitted when loaded channel goes online.
- `"offline"`: Emitted when loaded channel goes offline.
